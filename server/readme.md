# Next:
- Querry for nested objects passed down to the node server
- Append objects 
- Give me an example for store a video file with grid fs to 
mongodb and react
- !!! Will make an extra server for the /init-video route
- go check out the docs for GridFS
# https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/gridfs/

## New Package:
- nodemon
- script stand in package.json file 
- npm run watch

### Keywords:
- storage engine images
- Using Base64 Encoding 
- Better to store the image File on the server, otherwise the payload can be to big?


#### New Snippet for VC 
- Jump to line : strg/ctrl + g
- inside visual studio console + touch[filename] = build a new file 

### Later:
1. check the connect method, need to sperate it from the router
2. make a new server, try out the /init-video setting like it is 
3. store the buffer as BinData in the database, how can I get these data back to the video?
4. Streaming from Mongo DB, wrong question?
5. Is mongoose really neccesary ?
