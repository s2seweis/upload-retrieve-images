## Comment:
- Storing the Video Files into Mongo DB not the best practise, better using a provider like aws s3 buckt, and get from there a video url

### Packages:
- nodemon
- script stand in package.json file 
- npm run watch

# Keywords:
- storage engine images
- Using Base64 Encoding 
- Better to store the image File on the server, otherwise the payload can be to big?

#### New Snippet for VC 
- Jump to line : strg/ctrl + g
- inside visual studio console + touch[filename] = build a new file
