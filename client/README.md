### File Handler for React with Node and MongoDB

Covered Topics:

1. Lifting State to the next ancestor component in the state tree for avoiding async behaviour
2. Using local storage instead of a redux store & useSelector
3. Use of Custom Hooks like (useUser, useDidMount, useFileHandler)
4. Applying Suspense to let your component wait before it can render
5. Add Loader from Ant Design

### Result:
- File Handler for add images, image collections, pdf & videos to the database or the server


## Additional for the project:
1. Customize the file upload button


# Problems Encountered:
1. Async behaviour of the use state hook, not reflect state changes directly
