# File Handler for React with Node and MongoDB
-Project: Add images, image collections, pdf & videos to the database or the server

# Covered Topics:

- Lifting State to the next ancestor component in the state tree for avoiding async behaviour
- Using local storage instead of a redux store & useSelector
- Use of Custom Hooks like (useUser, useDidMount, useFileHandler)
- Applying Suspense to let your component wait before it can render
- Add Loader from Ant Design
- Axios requests, configuration of the header | 'Content-Type': 'application/json' versus 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' 

# Important: 
- You can place multiple defined objects in the body of an Axios POST request. 
- To do this, you can create an object that contains these two objects and then send that wrapper object in the request body.

1.  Additional for the project:
- Customize the file upload button

2.  Problems Encountered:
- Async behaviour of the use state hook, not reflect state changes directly 

3.  Comment to Headers: 
- Header plays a crucial role in conveying important information about the request being made

4. Next: 
- Build Playground & Add Route
